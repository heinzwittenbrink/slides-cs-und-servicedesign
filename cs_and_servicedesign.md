## Questions:

- Can we use service design to describe content strategy better?
- Can we understand content strategy as component of content strategy?
- Can content be understood as a dimension of services?

## Basics:

@[MikeAtherton](https://twitter.com/mikeatherton): [Customer Service Design: Content Strategy in the Spaces Between](https://de.slideshare.net/reduxd/designing-customer-service-content-strategy-in-the-spaces-between)

## In focus:

End-to-end-Experiences

Touchpoints

Systems

Content quality

##

> Touchpoints represent fundamental building blocks in the journeys of customers as they interact with a product or service in multiple channels over time.

# Service Design

## What is Service Design?

> The planning and organization of people, infrastructure, communications and touchpoints required to enable successful services. It strategically addresses the complexity of today's multi-touchpoints in a language of human experience.

##  Service Design Done Well

> "When two coffee houses open right next to each other, and each of them offers exactly the same coffee at exactly the same price, the service design decides whether you go into one and not the other."

## Service Design Basics

- Strict user orientation
- Multiple touchpoints
- Holistic approach - interaction of different components
- Frontend and backend design

## Content strategy is service design with content

- Content is a separate layer
- It is independent of specific touchpoints
- Content is always part of a service
- Front-end and back-end strategy work together
- Service design is *digital native*, but not *digital only*


## Anatomy of a service

> 1. services live through people, but they depend on a complex web of backstage systems and processes
> 2. people interact with a service via touchpoints. The set of all these touchpoints forms a service experience.
> 3. how the service is experienced directly determines the perception of the brand.

## CONTENT WITHIN A SERVICE

> Content is created and used by people. But it is managed by the same complex web of backstage systems and processes. Content is perceived through touchpoints.

<p class="rights">[Content Strategy in Service Design](https://de.slideshare.net/jennicolem/content-strategy-in-service-design/30)<p>

---

> A piece of content can be present at only one touchpoint, or it can move between touchpoints. The amount of all this content across all touchpoints creates a content experience.

<p class="rights">[Content Strategy in Service Design](https://de.slideshare.net/jennicolem/content-strategy-in-service-design/30)<p>
---

> How well the content works - or doesn't work - across the ecosystem affects the quality of the service experience. How content is perceived directly determines how brands are perceived.

##

- Content enables, explains and simplifies services
- Content makes the experience of services consistent and holistic

## Design process

Discover - Define- Develop - Deliver

# Design-Tools

## Szenarios describe the actor's contexts

> **Activity** What do they want to do? **Space** Where are they doing it? **Time** When is this all happening? **Personal** What's their emotional state and needs? **Channel** Which devices or platforms are used?

(Inspired by Cenny D D Bowles - Designing with context)

## Empathy Maps

## Directed Storytelling

> 1. Assign 1 person in your group to be “storyteller” and 1 person to be the “interviewer.”
>
> 2. STORYTELLer: Describe the process... Walk through every step in excruciating detail.*
>
> 3. INTERVIEWER: Ask the storyteller open-ended questions about the process.
>
> 4. NOTETAKERS: Using Post-its, document the details from the story. Keep it to 1 idea per Post-It.

<p class="rights">[DIRECTED STORYTELLING (5 MIN.)](https://de.slideshare.net/jennicolem/content-strategy-in-service-design/73)</p>

## Affinity Diagram

> 1. One by one, combine each notetaker’s Post-its into one diagram, grouping similar ideas together.
>
> 2. Collaborate as group to agree on clusters and then name the clusters.
>
> 3. Vote on the top three themes from the clusters that could diﬀerentiate the service experience if it was reimagined.

<p class="rights">[AFFINITY DIAGRAM (5 MIN.)](https://de.slideshare.net/jennicolem/content-strategy-in-service-design/74)</p>

## Customer Journey Mapping

> 1. Using the documented research as guidance, identify each stage of the user journey.
>
> 2. Identify the user’s actions, touchpoints, thoughts/emotions...
>
> 3. Identify the frontstage content elements -- content needs, content types and formats, channels and key messages.
>
> 4. IF TIME PERMITS: Focus on one or two areas of opportunity that would improve the experience.

# Contentstrategie and Content-Marketing

## Outside-in instead of Inside-out-Marketing

> “You listen for the needs of your clients and you build messages that serve those needs, on and in their terms,” said Mathewson, a distinguished technical marketer for search at IBM. “Then you place these messages in convenient places in their buyer journeys – typically search and social media settings.

---

> The messages attract them to your owned content marketing properties, where you can more deeply engage them, and ultimately convert them into loyal clients. This engagement initially takes the form of conditioning the conversation towards your brands and differentiating propositions, but ends in a strong relationship built on trust.”

## Marketing and Discovery

- Services become discoverable through content
- Services are distributed through content
- Content for external communication builds on content as components of a service
- Content makes services understandable


# Summary

## Key points

- User orientation instead of company orientation
- Independence from channels
- Strategy understood as holistic view, not as means-to-end relationship
- No strict separation between frontend and backend strategy
- Design and research as development of a common understanding
